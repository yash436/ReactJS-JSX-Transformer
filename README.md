# ReactJS-JSX-Transformer

- This is a basic JSX Transformer application that transforms our code on the left to ES5 on the right
- Based on Babel's own example page http://babeljs.io/repl/
- The bottom bar shows errors presented in the code in red text
- Some basic styling has been applied to the application
- It also uses Webpack and has all the dependencies listed already so just use npm install to get them
- npm start will load the server and use localhost to launch the application
- Trying putting in some code on the left and see the magic happen. E.g. [1, 2, 3].map(n => n+1 )
